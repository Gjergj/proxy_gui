                        When did tacos first appear in the United States?

                    <p>
                        Tacos are believed to have first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century. The
                        exact date is unclear, but their introduction is often attributed to Mexican immigrants who
                        brought the dish with them. Tacos gained popularity in the U.S. as Mexican cuisine became more
                        widespread, and they became a staple in Americanized Mexican food. The taco's popularity
                        continued to grow, eventually becoming a ubiquitous and beloved part of American culinary
                        culture.
